# School Performance Analysis

# PyCitySchools Analysis 

## Overview

This project, PyCitySchools, involves a detailed analysis of a local government area's school performance based on standardized test results. Utilizing Python's Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook, we aggregate data from various schools and students to uncover trends and insights that can assist in strategic decision-making for school budgets and priorities.

## Data Source

The analysis is grounded in two primary datasets:

**Schools Data** (schools_complete.csv): Contains details about each school, including type, size, and budget.
**Students Data** (students_complete.csv): Includes student demographics and their performance in math and reading standardized tests.

## Key Objectives

The primary goal is to synthesize these datasets to provide a comprehensive overview of the school system's performance. This includes:

**Local Government** Area Summary: A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics such as total schools, students, budget, average scores, and passing rates.
**School Summary:** Detailed insights into each school's performance, including budget allocations and academic achievements.
**Performance Analysis:** Identification of the highest and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
**Score Breakdowns by Year and Subject:** Analysis of average math and reading scores across different year levels at each school.
**Spending Analysis:** Examination of how spending per student influences school performance.
**Size and Type Analysis:** Investigation of the impact of school size and type (Government or Independent) on student performance.

## Methodology

The project employs various data manipulation techniques, such as merging datasets, grouping, binning, and aggregating data to draw meaningful conclusions. This approach allows for an in-depth analysis of how different factors affect school performance.

## Insights and Trends

The analysis aims to uncover trends such as the relationship between budget allocation and student performance, the impact of school size on learning outcomes, and the effectiveness of different school types. These insights are crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Tools and Libraries Used

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For efficient handling of dataframes.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive coding environment and presentation of results.

## Final Thoughts

This project not only provides a data-driven overview of the current state of schools in the local government area but also lays the groundwork for data-informed strategies to enhance educational outcomes across the district.
